This is a collection of various 3d models I made for the gridfinity system.

To make these models, I'm using a combination of:
- Fusion 360 for personal use
- Tinker CAD
- Gridfinity Generator: https://gridfinitygenerator.com/

Some of the more standard boxes / pieces will come without notes. If there's something I want to mention or keep track of, I'll make a folder and add a README in that folder about the models.
