This is a set of models I used to print a cassette box within the gridfinity system.

There is a single box for a single cassette, and a large box that holds 10 cassettes. I was able to print both in a Bambu P1S, with both PETG and PLA.

This assumes a 42x42mm standard gridfinity system, with 6x2mm magnets (if applicable).
